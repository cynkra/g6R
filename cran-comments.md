* This is a new release.
* Package size is more than 5 MB due to the JavaScript [dependencies](https://github.com/antvis/G6). I have no way to reduce the size further as I have no control over the size of the dependencies. The JS has been minimized as much as I could using webpack and standard JS minification techniques.
