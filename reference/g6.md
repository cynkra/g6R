# Create a G6 Graph Visualization

Creates an interactive graph visualization using the G6 graph
visualization library. This function is the main entry point for
creating G6 graph visualizations in R.

## Usage

``` r
g6(
  nodes = NULL,
  edges = NULL,
  combos = NULL,
  jsonUrl = NULL,
  iconsUrl = "//at.alicdn.com/t/font_2678727_za4qjydwkkh.js",
  width = "100%",
  height = NULL,
  elementId = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- nodes:

  A data frame or list of nodes in the graph. Each node should have at
  least an "id" field. See 'Data Structure' section for more details.
  Default: NULL.

- edges:

  A data frame or list of edges in the graph. Each edge should have
  "source" and "target" fields identifying the connected nodes. See
  'Data Structure' section for more details. Default: NULL.

- combos:

  A data frame or list of combo groups in the graph. Each combo should
  have at least an "id" field. Nodes can be assigned to combos using
  their "combo" field. See 'Data Structure' section for more details.
  Default: NULL.

- jsonUrl:

  An url pointing to a valid JSON containing the graph data in G6
  format. See <https://assets.antv.antgroup.com/g6/20000.json> for an
  example. Can't be used at the same time as `nodes`, `edges`, and
  `combos`.

- iconsUrl:

  A URL pointing to a JavaScript file containing custom icons. Default
  provides reasonable set of icons from
  <https://at.alicdn.com/t/project/2678727/caef142c-804a-4a2f-a914-ae82666a31ee.html?spm=a313x.7781069.1998910419.35>.

- width:

  Width of the graph container in pixels or as a valid CSS unit.
  Default: NULL (automatic sizing).

- height:

  Height of the graph container in pixels or as a valid CSS unit.
  Default: NULL (automatic sizing).

- elementId:

  A unique ID for the graph HTML element. Default: NULL (automatically
  generated).

## Value

An htmlwidget object that can be printed, included in R Markdown
documents, or used in Shiny applications. This widget contains the graph
data and configuration necessary to render the G6 graph visualization.

## Details

The `g6` function creates a G6 graph as an htmlwidget that can be used
in R Markdown, Shiny applications, or rendered to HTML. It takes graph
data in the form of nodes, edges, and optional combo groupings, along
with various configuration options for customizing the appearance and
behavior of the graph.

### Nodes

The `nodes` parameter should be a data frame or list of nodes with at
least an `id` field for each node. Additional fields can include:

- `id` (required): Unique identifier for the node. Must be a character.

- `type`: Node type (e.g., "circle", "rect", "diamond").

- `data`: Custom data associated with the node.

- `style`: List of style attributes (color, size, etc.).

- `states`: String. Initial states for the node, such as selected,
  active, hover, etc.

- `combo`: ID of the combo this node belongs to.

- `ports`: Node ports. Can also be passed inside the style field.

### Edges

The `edges` parameter should be a data frame or list of edges with at
least `source` and `target` fields identifying the connected nodes.
Additional fields can include:

- `source` (required): ID of the source node. Must be a character.

- `target` (required): ID of the target node. Must be a character.

- `id`: Unique identifier for the edge.

- `type`: Edge type (e.g., "line", "cubic", "arc").

- `data`: Custom data associated with the edge.

- `style`: List of style attributes (color, width, etc.).

- `states`: String. Initial states for the edge.

### Combos

The `combos` parameter is used for grouping nodes and can be a data
frame or list with combo definitions. Fields include:

- `id` (required): Unique identifier for the combo. Must be a character.

- `type`: String: Combo type. It can be the type of built-in Combo, or
  the custom Combo.

- `data`: Custom data associated with the combo.

- `style`: List of style attributes.

- `states`: String. Initial states for the combo.

- `combo`: String. Parent combo ID. If there is no parent combo, it is
  null.

Nodes are assigned to combos by setting their `combo` field to the ID of
the combo.

## Examples

``` r
# Create a simple graph with two nodes and one edge
nodes <- data.frame(
  id = c("node1", "node2")
)

edges <- data.frame(
  source = "node1",
  target = "node2"
)

g6(nodes = nodes, edges = edges)

{"x":{"data":{"nodes":[{"id":"node1"},{"id":"node2"}],"edges":[{"source":"node1","target":"node2","id":"node1-node2"}]},"jsonUrl":null,"iconsUrl":"//at.alicdn.com/t/font_2678727_za4qjydwkkh.js","mode":"prod","preservePosition":false},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}
```
