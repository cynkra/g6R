\title{Show previously hidden elements in a g6 graph}
\usage{
g6_show_elements(graph, ids, animation = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A g6 graph object or a g6_proxy object for Shiny applications.}

\item{ids}{Character vector specifying the IDs of elements to show.
Can include node IDs, edge IDs, or combo IDs.}

\item{animation}{Boolean to toggle animation.}
}
\value{
The modified g6 graph or g6_proxy object, allowing for method chaining.
}
\description{
This function displays previously hidden elements (nodes, edges, or combos) in a g6 graph.
This restores visibility to elements that were hidden using \code{\link{g6_hide_elements}}.
}
\details{
This function makes previously hidden elements visible again. Elements must exist
in the graph's data structure (i.e., they must have been hidden rather than removed).

When elements are shown again, the graph may recalculate layout positions, which
can cause other elements to reposition.
