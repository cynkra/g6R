\title{Create an AntV Combo Combined Layout}
\usage{
combo_combined_layout(
  center = NULL,
  comboPadding = 10,
  innerLayout = NULL,
  nodeSize = 10,
  outerLayout = NULL,
  spacing = NULL,
  treeKey = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{center}{Layout center coordinates. A numeric vector of length 2 \code{[x, y]}.
If NULL, uses the graph center. Default is NULL.}

\item{comboPadding}{Padding value inside the combo, used only for force
calculation, not for rendering. It is recommended to set the same value
as the visual padding. Can be a number, numeric vector, function, or
JS function. Default is 10.}

\item{innerLayout}{Layout algorithm for elements inside the combo. Should be
a Layout object or function. If NULL, uses ConcentricLayout as default.}

\item{nodeSize}{Node size (diameter), used for collision detection. If not
specified, it is calculated from the node's size property. Can be a number,
numeric vector, function, or JS function. Default is 10.}

\item{outerLayout}{Layout algorithm for the outermost layer. Should be a
Layout object or function. If NULL, uses ForceLayout as default.}

\item{spacing}{Minimum spacing between node/combo edges when preventNodeOverlap
or preventOverlap is true. Can be a number, function, or JS function for
different nodes. Default is NULL.}

\item{treeKey}{Tree key identifier as a character string. Default is NULL.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the layout configuration.}
}
\value{
A layout configuration object for use with G6 graphs.
}
\description{
Creates a combo combined layout configuration for G6 graphs. This layout
algorithm combines different layout strategies for elements inside combos
and the outermost layer, providing hierarchical organization of graph elements.
}
\details{
The combo combined layout is particularly useful for graphs with hierarchical
structures where you want different layout algorithms for different levels
of the hierarchy. The inner layout handles elements within combos, while
the outer layout manages the overall arrangement.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic combo combined layout
layout <- combo_combined_layout()

# Custom configuration with specific center and padding
layout <- combo_combined_layout(
  comboPadding = 20,
  nodeSize = 15,
  spacing = 10
)
}
