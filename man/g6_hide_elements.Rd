\title{Hide elements in a g6 graph}
\usage{
g6_hide_elements(graph, ids, animation = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A g6 graph object or a g6_proxy object for Shiny applications.}

\item{ids}{Character vector specifying the IDs of elements to hide.
Can include node IDs, edge IDs, or combo IDs.}

\item{animation}{Boolean to toggle animation.}
}
\value{
The modified g6 graph or g6_proxy object, allowing for method chaining.
}
\description{
This function hides specified elements (nodes, edges, or combos) in a g6 graph.
Hidden elements are removed from view but remain in the graph data structure.
}
\details{
When elements are hidden, they are removed from the visual display but still exist
in the underlying data structure. This means they can be shown again later using
\code{\link{g6_show_elements}} without having to recreate them.

Hidden elements will not participate in layout calculations, which may cause other
elements to reposition.
