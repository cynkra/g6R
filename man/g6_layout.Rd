\title{Set the layout algorithm for a g6 graph}
\usage{
g6_layout(graph, layout = list(type = "force"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A g6 graph object created with \code{g6()}.}

\item{layout}{A list specifying the layout algorithm and its configuration parameters.
At minimum, this list should contain a \code{type} element specifying the layout algorithm.
Additional parameters depend on the layout type chosen. Default is \code{list(type = "force")}.}
}
\value{
The modified g6 graph object with the specified layout, allowing for method chaining.
}
\description{
This function configures the layout algorithm used to position nodes in a g6 graph.
G6 provides various layout algorithms such as 'force', 'radial', 'circular', 'grid',
'concentric', 'dagre', and more. Each layout has its own set of configurable parameters.
}
\details{
G6 provides several layout algorithms, each suitable for different graph structures:

\itemize{
\item \strong{force}: Force-directed layout using physical simulation of forces
\item \strong{random}: Random layout placing nodes randomly
\item \strong{circular}: Arranges nodes on a circle
\item \strong{radial}: Radial layout with nodes arranged outward from a central node
\item \strong{grid}: Arranges nodes in a grid pattern
\item \strong{concentric}: Concentric circles with important nodes in the center
\item \strong{dagre}: Hierarchical layout for directed acyclic graphs
\item \strong{fruchterman}: Force-directed layout based on the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm
\item \strong{mds}: Multidimensional scaling layout
\item \strong{comboForce}: Force-directed layout specially designed for combo graphs
}

Each layout algorithm has specific configuration options. See the G6 documentation
for detailed information on each layout and its parameters:
