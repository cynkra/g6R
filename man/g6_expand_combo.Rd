\title{Expand a combo element in a g6 graph}
\usage{
g6_expand_combo(graph, id, options = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A g6 graph object or a g6_proxy object for Shiny applications.}

\item{id}{Character string specifying the ID of the combo to collapse.}

\item{options}{List containing optional configuration parameters for the collapse action:
\itemize{
\item \code{animate}: Logical value indicating whether to animate the collapsing process. Default is \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{aling}: Logical value to ensure the position of expanded/collapsed nodes remains unchanged.
}}
}
\value{
The modified g6 graph or g6_proxy object, allowing for method chaining.
}
\description{
This function expands a specified combo (a group of nodes) in a g6 graph,
making its member nodes and edges visible. This is useful for revealing
detailed structure within hierarchical groups that were previously collapsed.
}
\details{
When a combo is expanded, its member nodes and edges become visible in the graph,
revealing the internal structure of the group. This operation is the opposite of
collapsing a combo.

Expanding a combo is particularly useful in interactive graph exploration where
users may want to drill down into specific parts of a graph hierarchy.

To collapse an expanded combo, use the \code{\link{g6_collapse_combo}} function.
